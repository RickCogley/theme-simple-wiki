# Simple Wiki

[Lume](https://lume.land) theme to create a simple wiki.

- Use markdown to save the pages
- Instant search engine.

## Install as remote theme

The **fastest and easiest** way to use this theme is by importing it as a remote
module. It allows to create a blog in seconds and update it at any time just
changing the version number in the import url. Just add the following code to
your `_config.ts` file:

```ts
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import wiki from "https://deno.land/x/lume_theme_simple_wiki@v0.1.0/mod.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(wiki());

export default site;
```

### Multilanguage support

Use the `languages` option to configure a multilanguage site:

```ts
site.use(wiki({
  languages: ["en", "gl", "es"],
}));
```

You can see an example in the [demo](./demo) folder. To customize it copy the
[`_data.yml`](./src/_data.yml) file in your blog root folder and edit it with
your own data.

## Use it as base template

To use this theme as a base template for a more customized blog, clone this repo
and edit the [_config.ts](./_config.ts) file. The source files are in the
[src](./src/) folder. And you can remove the `/demo` folder.
